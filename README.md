#Maker BnB project
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Andy-Bell/makersbnb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Andy-Bell/makersbnb) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Andy-Bell/makersbnb/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Andy-Bell/makersbnb?branch=master)

After much deliberation I feel the technologies selected for this project were not suitable for the task in question. This project is being paused and will likely be completely restarted in the future, with a database that is definitely relational for starters.


Made as part of the course at [Makers Academy] (www.makersacademy.com).

###App Description

A web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to 
hire spaces for the night.

###Styleguide
For contributors, we would like to use [this styleguide] (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to achieve code consistency.

###User Stories
These are based on the initial [brief] (https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/lab_week/makers_bnb_specification.md) and can be found [here] (/docs/UserStories.md).

###Testing framework
All tests throughout the stack will be done in [Mocha 2.5.3] (https://mochajs.org/) and [Zombie 4.2.1] (http://zombie.js.org/).

###Technologies
The application is built using jQuery front end and Node/Express backend, 
running with a MongoDB database.
